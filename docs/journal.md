### Vector Database Migration - ChromaDB to Weaviate

- Migrated from ChromaDB to Weaviate as the vector database backend
- Created a new modular structure for vector database and embedding operations:
  - Created `src/financials/pipeline/weaviate_client.py` for Weaviate integration
  - Created `src/financials/pipeline/embeddings.py` to extract and modularize embedding functionality
  - Refactored `pdf_processor.py` to use the new components
- Updated dependencies in pyproject.toml (removed chromadb, added weaviate-client)
- Improved separation of concerns with dedicated classes for each responsibility
- Enhanced code modularity to make future vector database switches easier
- Added Weaviate to docker-compose.yml:
  - Configured proper container settings and persistent volume storage
  - Set up environment variables for connecting to Weaviate
  - Updated PDF processor to use environment variables for connection details

**Technology Updates:**
- Added Weaviate as the vector database backend
- Created a flexible EmbeddingService that supports multiple embedding providers
- Containerized Weaviate with Docker Compose

**Next Steps:**
- Add comprehensive testing for the new vector database integration
- Implement more advanced vector search capabilities
- Create health check endpoints for Weaviate connection
